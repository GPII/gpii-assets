## Site Config Tool

### template.json

The purpose of the `template.json` file is to dynamically show/hide editable `machineName` properties within the site config tool.
The template consists of groups of items which are populated along with the title.
Each item consists of `title`, `body`, `controlType` and corresponding `machineName` keys.
